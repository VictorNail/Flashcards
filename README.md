# Flashcards

## Project description

The flashcards application aims to provide a fun platform to help learners memorize information using interactive cards. It can be used to create, manage and play learning sessions tailored to each user.

## Functional rules
#### Managing flashcards
- Adding a flashcard :
  - A flashcard contains :
  - A question.
  - 4 possible answers
  - A correct answer.
  - Tags to associate the flashcard with one or more categories (e.g. math, history).
#### Managing game sessions
- Launch a game session for a student:
  - Select a flashcard category.
  - Generate a session containing 5 flashcards chosen at random from the selected category.
  - A game session has no time limit.
  - Respond to a list of flashcards:
  - Flashcards must be presented one by one.
 - Each response is recorded in the session as correct or incorrect.

#### Saving data
Record:
  - The student's score.
  - The list of answers provided by the student for each session.
  - Session status:
  - Next question.
  - Session completed or not.
